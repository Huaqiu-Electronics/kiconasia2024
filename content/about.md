## About KiCon Europe 2024
The KiCad Conference Europe is the annual gathering of KiCad developers,
users, designers and advocates from around Europe and beyond

KiCad is the world's most popular EDA software package.  We are the voice
for high quality circuit design software in the PCB industry.  We are a
global organization of developers, users, and advocates of free, open,
accessible design.

The main focus of the KiCad organization is developing world-leading
open-source software that enables everyone to learn, design and build
circuits that power tomorrow's world.  We advocate for open standards allowing
cross-collaboration, lowered costs and improved outcomes.

KiCon is a community event organized by volunteers.  We are focused on
building a diverse and sustainable open community, sharing our own experiences
and learning from others. Although it is software that brings us together, it's
the deep care for the society and the environment that surrounds us, helping
solve the world's problems one bit at a time, that connects us.

The international conference series started in 2019 in Chicago, IL. The European
conference started after COVID and has been joined with KiCon Asia in Schezhen, China.
