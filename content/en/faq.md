{{< faq "How do I apply for a China visa?" >}}
More and more countries are eligible for 144-hour visa-free transit or 5 day visa-on-arrival, giving you more flexibility when planning your trip. Which route you take will depend on 1) the country of your passport 2) port of entry and 3) if you want to spend time in Hong Kong. Please note that Hong Kong has it’s own visa policies independant of mainland China.

If traveling directly to Shenzhen via plane then check if you are eligible for 144-hour visa-free transit. This also applies if you are flying directly to Hong Kong and transferring to Shenzhen directly by ferry. If you will first spend time in Hong Kong then travel up to Shenzhen then consider the 5-day Visa on Arrival or Port Visa. Passport holders of a few select countries are also elligible for 15 day visa-free entry and some do not have any restrictions at all.

Please check [Venue](./venue/about-venue.md) page for details.

{{< faq "How can I get to Shenzhen?" >}}
If you're traveling to Shenzhen from abroad, here are several transportation options you can consider:

1. **Direct Flights**: Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport (SZX) offers numerous international flights. Depending on your country and city of origin, you can choose a direct flight to Shenzhen. You can check specific flight details and prices through airline websites or flight booking platforms.

2. **Via Hong Kong**: If there are no direct flights available from your country or region, you can fly to Hong Kong first and then take one of the following to reach Shenzhen:
   - **High-Speed Rail**: Take the Airport Express from Hong Kong International Airport to Kowloon Station, then transfer to the high-speed train that goes directly to Shenzhen, which takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes in total.
   - **Cross-Border Bus**: Board a cross-border bus at Hong Kong International Airport that goes directly to Shenzhen's immigration ports such as Huanggang Port, Shenzhen Bay Port, or Liantang Port. The bus ride takes about 1 hour.
   - **Ferry Services**: If you are not averse to traveling by boat, you can take a ferry from Hong Kong Airport to Shekou in Shenzhen or the Shenzhen Airport Ferry Terminal, with a boat ride taking about 30 minutes to 1 hour.

3. **Private Transportation**: If you have access to private transportation in Hong Kong or opt for a private car rental service, you can also drive to Shenzhen. However, be aware of the relevant regulations and procedures for cross-border vehicle travel.

It's recommended that you plan and book your transportation in advance based on your personal situation and needs. Also, considering potential time differences and flight connections, it's advisable to allow for sufficient transit time.
